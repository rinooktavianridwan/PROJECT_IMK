# React + Vite Government Website Template

This repository serves as a foundational template for developing a simple government website using React within the Vite framework. 

## Official Plugins

This template currently supports two official Vite plugins:

1. **[@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md):**
   - Integrates [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) to enable Fast Refresh for efficient development iterations.

2. **[@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc):**
   - Utilizes [SWC](https://swc.rs/) as a tool for Fast Refresh, enhancing the performance of the development environment.

Feel free to use and extend this template to create a robust government website with common features typically found in governmental online platforms.
